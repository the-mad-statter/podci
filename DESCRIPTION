Description: The pediatric outcomes data collection instrument (PODCI) is a 
    patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) developed by the Pediatric 
    Orthopedic Society of North America to assess functional health status in 
    children with musculoskeletal disorders. PODCI evaluates functional health 
    status through an 86 item questionnaire. The pediatric form (2 years to 10 
    years 11 months) is completed by parents. The adolescent form (11 years to 
    18 years 11 months) is answered by parents (parent report) and adolescents 
    (self-report). PODCI consists of scores on five core scales plus a sixth 
    global scale. Four scales encompass physical function and one assesses 
    psychological well-being. Physical function core scales include (1) Upper 
    Extremity and Physical Function (UPEX), which measures ability to perform 
    activities of daily living with upper extremities, such as lifting books 
    and turning doorknobs; (2) Transfer and Basic Mobility (TRAN), which 
    measures ability to perform activities of daily living with lower 
    extremities and trunk, such as standing, sitting, and transfers; (3) 
    Sports and Physical Functioning (SPRT), which measures capacity for 
    physical activity like running and walking more than one mile; and (4) 
    Pain/Comfort (PAIN), which quantifies pain and its interference with 
    activities. The psychological well-being core scale is Happiness (HAPY), 
    which assesses a childâ€™s happiness with physical appearance, capabilities, 
    and health.
